## DEMO PHOTOGRAPHER WEBSITE
Photographer website, demo version

For this project I used only: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.

Status: Work in Progress (final adjustments ongoing): some sections such as notes pages are still missing. 
Certain parts, like the cookie banner, are still in Italian but will be translated soon. The site will be bilingual.

LIVE DEMO: https://basobax.github.io/Photographer-website-demo/

## Portfolio Pages

The project now includes dedicated portfolio pages featuring:
- A masonry-style image grid layout
- A fullscreen slideshow that activates on image click

A language switcher button has also been added to the site, allowing users to toggle between supported languages.  
Note: This button has been intentionally omitted from the homepage, as it contains no significant translatable content.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure in this demo version differs from the intended structure of the final website.

Currently, all portfolio content is grouped together in a shared folder.  
In the production version, each portfolio will be placed in its own dedicated folder, including its respective:
- Images
- CSS files
- Other related assets

This setup allows for:
- Easier portfolio management
- Clean removal of individual portfolios without leaving residual files
